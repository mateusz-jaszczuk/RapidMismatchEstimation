# Rapid Mismatch Estimation
Welcome to [Rapid Mismatch Estimation](https://mateusz-jaszczuk.github.io/rme/) GitHub Page! Below you can find attached prject code.

## Robot Compatibility
The following code was designed for [Franka Emika Research](https://www.franka.de/) manipulator. If you wish to use it with different robots, adjust the DH-parameters in Forward Kinematics code, and re-train the Neural Network.


## Using the Code



### ROS Package

Mention input shapes
